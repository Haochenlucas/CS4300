function trials = CS4300_run_trials(max_steps)
% CS4300_run_trials - trails runner
% It runs 2000 trials to analyze the behavior of a random agent 
% On input:
%     max_steps (int): maximum number of steps allowed
% On output:
%     report (report data structure): values needed for the report
%       gold (double): the percentage of times the agent arrives at square [2, 2].
%       mean (double): the mean of the number of steps the agent survives
%       variance (double): the variance of the number of steps the agent survives
%       ci (double): the 95% confidence interval
% Call:
%     report = CS4300_report(50);
