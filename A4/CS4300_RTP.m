function [Sip, finished] = CS4300_RTP(sentences,thm,vars)
% CS4300_RTP - resolution theorem prover
% On input:
%     sentences (CNF data structure): array of conjuctive clauses
%       (i).clauses
%           each clause is a list of integers (- for negated literal)
%     thm (CNF data structure): 1 disjunctive clause to be tested
%     vars (1xn vector): list of variables (positive integers)
% On output:
%     Sip (CNF data structure): results of resolution
%        []: proved sentence |- thm
%        not []: thm does not follow from sentences
%     finished (boolean): this function is done in 30 sec
% Method:
%  Let S1 = S.
% Let i = 1.
% LOOP until i = n + 1.
% Discard members of Si in which a literal and its
%    complement appear, to obtain Sip.
% Let Ti be the set of parent clauses in Sip in which Pi or
%    -Pi appears.
% Let Ui be the set of resolvent clauses obtained by
%     resolving (over Pi ) every pair of clauses C U {Pi} and
%     D U {-Pi} in Ti.
% Set Si+1 equal to (Sip\Ti) U Ui . (Eliminate Pi ).
% Let i be increased by 1.
% ENDLOOP.
% Output Sn+1.
